# March 13th, 2020 Updates

## Progress

* Met with group to figure out computer-car connection, again.

## Problems

* We can't tell if the wires are wrong, if the program is wrong, or both.
* We also can't tell if the car even works.

## Plans

* Get together with the team this weekend to create the motor-computer connection
* Communicate with client on how he was able to setup the motors.
